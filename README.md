Copy text on Windows and receive it on Android. Share a PDF from Android and download it
on an iPhone. Send a photo from iOS and receive it automatically on the PC.

Clipboard Bridge connects **Windows, Android and iOS/iPadOS** through one private,
self-hosted clipboard. Text, photos and files of any type use the same Send and Receive
workflow: the most recently uploaded item is always the current clipboard item.

No cloud account is required. Use the Windows app itself as the server, or run the
standalone Python/Docker server on a NAS, Raspberry Pi, home server or Docker host.

## Platform support

| Platform | Integration | Send | Receive | Server history |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Windows 10/11** | Tray application | Clipboard, configurable hotkeys and auto-sync | Manual or automatic, with clickable file notifications | Local history plus server operations |
| **Android 10+** | Native application | Clipboard, file picker, universal Share target and Quick Settings | Latest item, exact history item or automatic monitoring | Live list with download and per-item deletion |
| **iPhone/iPad** | Two iOS Shortcuts | Text, photos and files from the clipboard or Share Sheet | Latest text, photo or file | Available through the web interface |
| **Web browser** | Standalone server page | Paste text or upload files | Copy or download any history item | Browse, refresh and delete |

### What can be transferred

- Unicode text, links and multiline content.
- Photos and clipboard images.
- PDFs, archives, office documents, audio, video and files with custom extensions.
- One file or multiple files selected from Android's Share menu.
- Multiple files copied or selected together stay together as **one history item** on
  the server, Windows and Android. Receiving that item restores the whole group; deleting
  it removes the group in one action. Generic clients and iPhone Shortcuts receive the
  same group as a ZIP archive.

Clipboard Bridge does not assign a higher priority to files or images. Arrival order is
the only rule.

## Quick start

1. Choose a server: enable **Server mode** in the Windows app, or start the standalone
   Docker/Python server.
2. Use the same server address on Windows, Android and both iPhone Shortcuts.
3. Leave authentication empty for the general shared clipboard, or configure the same
   optional token/account on every device.
4. Send from one device and receive the latest item from another.

## How it works

![Two alternative and bidirectional Clipboard Bridge connection modes](docs/assets/two-modes.png)

Choose one mode. In both cases every connection is bidirectional and the active server
keeps one ordered history for each clipboard space. **Text, images and files have
exactly the same priority:** the latest request is always the latest item.

Every device must use the same:

- server address and port;
- shared space or account;
- token, username and password when authentication is enabled.

> **Authentication is optional.** With no token or accounts configured, every device
> uses the general shared clipboard. When token or account links are used, `token`,
> `user` and `password` are visible as plain text in the URL. Local HTTP does not encrypt
> them: use only a trusted LAN, a private VPN, or an HTTPS reverse proxy.

The Android history is a live view of `GET /clipboard/history`. It is not stored as a
separate Android history.

## Choose a server mode

Clipboard Bridge supports two distinct setups.

| | **Windows Server mode** | **Standalone server** |
|---|---|---|
| Server runs on | The Windows app | Docker/Python host |
| Extra computer required | No | Yes, or an always-on NAS/home server |
| Web interface | No | Yes |
| Android support | Yes | Yes |
| iPhone Shortcuts | Yes | Yes |
| Windows client | The same app | One or more Windows clients |
| Best for | Fast setup and direct phone-to-PC use | Multiple users and an always-on service |

### Fastest setup: use Windows as the server

1. Install or open Clipboard Bridge on Windows.
2. Open **Settings > General** and select **Server mode**.
3. Keep port `5088`, unless it is already used.
4. Copy the address displayed by the Windows app, for example
   `http://192.168.1.20:5088`.
5. Allow Clipboard Bridge through Windows Firewall when requested.
6. Enter the same address in Android and in both iPhone Shortcuts.

No Docker container or separate web server is required.

### Always-on setup: use Docker or Python

1. Start the standalone server on a NAS, Raspberry Pi, PC or Docker host.
2. Open `http://SERVER_IP:5088/` to verify the web interface.
3. Put the Windows app in **Client mode**.
4. Configure Android and iPhone with the same server address.

## Android

The native Android client supports Android 10 and later and reads its history directly
from the selected Clipboard Bridge server.

### Features

- Send and receive Unicode text.
- Send photos, PDFs, archives and arbitrary files.
- Save received files in `Downloads/Clipboard Bridge`.
- Put received text or file URIs into the Android clipboard.
- Live server history, refreshed every five seconds while the app is visible.
- Restore any item directly from server history.
- Delete individual server-history items after confirmation.
- Android Share menu target for text, images and files.
- **Send clipboard** and **Receive clipboard** Quick Settings tiles.
- Optional foreground monitoring for new server items.
- Separate notification settings for incoming text, incoming files and sent items.
- Shared token and isolated account authentication.
- English and Italian interface.

### Install the APK

1. Download the [Android APK](https://github.com/Mattboxx/Clipboard-Bridge/releases/download/2.0.7/Clipboard.Bridge.Android.universal.V1.0.0-beta.10.apk).
2. Open the downloaded file on the Android device.
3. If requested, allow the browser or file manager to install apps from that source.
4. Choose **Install** or **Update**.
5. Open Clipboard Bridge and allow notifications if you want automatic monitoring.

Updates signed by this project keep the existing Android configuration.

### Configure Android

1. Open the gear button.
2. Enter only the server base address, for example:

   ```text
   http://192.168.1.20:5088
   ```

3. Choose **Shared space** when using the general clipboard.
4. Enter the API token only when the server uses `CLIPBOARD_TOKEN`.
5. Choose **Account** only when that username exists in `CLIPBOARD_ACCOUNTS`.
6. Enter the account username and password.
7. Run **Test connection**, then save.

For account mode, the status strip must show **Connected - @USERNAME**. Android appends
`user` and `password` to every request URL, so it loads that account's isolated
clipboard rather than the shared space. The **Server history** section then displays
the same items returned by:

```text
http://SERVER_IP:5088/clipboard/history?limit=200&user=USERNAME&password=PASSWORD
```

If Android and the web page show different histories, check that both are using the
same shared space or the same account.

### Use the Android app

- **Send clipboard:** uploads the current Android clipboard.
- **Receive latest:** downloads the newest server item and places it in the clipboard.
- **Send file:** opens Android's file picker.
- **Send file:** can select one or several files; a multiple selection appears as one
  server-history row and is restored to the Android clipboard as one group.
- **History item:** downloads that exact server item.
- **Trash button:** deletes only that item from the selected account or shared server
  history after a confirmation prompt.
- **Share to Clipboard Bridge:** appears in Android's Share menu for text, images,
  documents and arbitrary file types. One or several selected files are uploaded
  directly without leaving the main Clipboard Bridge screen open.

### Add the Quick Settings controls

1. Pull down Android Quick Settings twice.
2. Tap **Edit** or the pencil button.
3. Find **Send clipboard** and **Receive clipboard**.
4. Drag both into the active controls.

The controls use a transparent helper because Android requires a focused activity for
reliable clipboard access. Clipboard Bridge immediately returns to the previous screen;
the main app is not opened.

### Android automatic synchronization

Android 10 and later prevent ordinary background applications from continuously reading
the clipboard. Clipboard Bridge therefore uses these supported workflows:

- incoming monitoring uses an optional foreground service and notification;
- **Receive clipboard** is always available from Quick Settings;
- outgoing auto-send works while Clipboard Bridge is visible;
- the Share menu and **Send clipboard** tile work from other applications.

Some Android manufacturers apply additional battery restrictions. If monitoring stops,
exclude Clipboard Bridge from battery optimization and keep its foreground notification
enabled.

See [android/README.md](android/README.md) for build instructions and technical details.

## Windows

The Windows client runs from the notification area.

### Windows local history versus server history

The Windows app can record a private local history. This is different from server
history:

- **local history** contains clipboard events observed on that Windows PC;
- **server history** contains items actually uploaded to the selected server;
- Android, iPhone and the web interface can only see server history.

Enable **Automatic synchronization** or use **Send clipboard** to publish Windows items
to the server.

> Clipboard changes made by applications running as administrator may be hidden from a
> normal Windows process. If Windows auto-sync misses those changes, run Clipboard Bridge
> as administrator too.

## iPhone and iPad

iOS uses two universal Shortcuts. The same pair handles text, photos, single files and
multiple files without asking which content type is being transferred.

### Send the current clipboard

Install [iPhone Load Clipboard](https://github.com/Mattboxx/Clipboard-Bridge/releases/download/2.0.7/iPhone.Load.Clipboard.shortcut)
and set its request URL to:

```text
http://SERVER_IP:5088/clipboard
```

For automatic multiple-file sharing, configure **Load Clipboard** as described in the
[complete guide](GUIDE.md#51-send-clipboard-to-server). When the Share Sheet or clipboard
contains several files, the Shortcut creates a temporary ZIP and sends it to
`/clipboard/bundle`. Clipboard Bridge safely opens that transport archive and stores its
members as one grouped history item. A ZIP deliberately shared as one file through the
normal `/clipboard` endpoint remains an ordinary ZIP file.

For a single file, the upgraded Shortcut also sends its URL-encoded name using
`?filename=NAME` (or `&filename=NAME` after account/token parameters). This preserves
unknown extensions such as `.shortcut` even when iOS reports only a generic binary MIME
type. The [complete guide](GUIDE.md#51-send-clipboard-to-server) shows the required
actions; text continues to use the URL without the filename parameter.

### Receive the latest item

Install [iPhone Download Clipboard](https://github.com/Mattboxx/Clipboard-Bridge/releases/download/2.0.7/iPhone.Download.Clipboard.shortcut)
and set its URL to:

```text
http://SERVER_IP:5088/clipboard/latest/raw
```

The upgraded receive Shortcut first checks `/clipboard/latest/meta`. If the latest item
is a group, it extracts the returned transport ZIP and copies every member together;
otherwise it follows the normal text/photo/file path. The choice is automatic.

Add both Shortcuts to the iPhone Control Center for one-swipe access:

1. Open Control Center customization.
2. Add a **Shortcut** control.
3. Select **Load Clipboard**.
4. Add a second control and select **Download Clipboard**.

For an isolated account, append the encoded username and password:

```text
http://SERVER_IP:5088/clipboard?user=alice&password=secret
http://SERVER_IP:5088/clipboard/latest/raw?user=alice&password=secret
```

For the shared API token:

```text
http://SERVER_IP:5088/clipboard?token=YOUR_TOKEN
http://SERVER_IP:5088/clipboard/latest/raw?token=YOUR_TOKEN
```

The [complete setup guide](GUIDE.md) includes detailed Shortcut actions and file/photo
behavior.

## Standalone server

### Docker Compose

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mattboxx/Clipboard-Bridge.git
cd Clipboard-Bridge
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open `http://localhost:5088/`. Persistent data is stored in `./data`.

### Python

```bash
pip install -r requirements-server.txt
python clipboard_bridge-Server.py
```

### App stores

The separate [Clipboard Bridge App Store](https://github.com/Mattboxx/Clipboard-Bridge-AppStore)
provides installation instructions for ZimaOS, Portainer, Umbrel, Runtipi, Dockge and
standard Docker Compose.

The permanent ZimaOS source is:

```

## Server configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `CLIPBOARD_PORT` | `5088` | Listening port |
| `CLIPBOARD_TOKEN` | empty | Optional shared API token |
| `CLIPBOARD_PASSWORD` | empty | Optional web login password |
| `CLIPBOARD_ACCOUNTS` | empty | Comma-separated `user:password` accounts |
| `CLIPBOARD_ACCOUNTS_FILE` | empty | File containing one `user:password` per line |
| `CLIPBOARD_MAX_HISTORY` | `200` | Server history limit |
| `CLIPBOARD_MAX_UPLOAD_MB` | `64` | Maximum upload size |
| `CLIPBOARD_DATA_DIR` | `./clipboard_data` | Persistent data folder |

The shared clipboard remains available when accounts are added. Accounts have separate
histories and there is no fixed account-count limit. For large installations, use
`CLIPBOARD_ACCOUNTS_FILE`.

## Network and security

Clipboard Bridge is designed for private networks.

- API tokens and isolated accounts are optional; the general clipboard works without
  either one.
- iPhone and Android account links place `user` and `password` in plain text in the URL.
  Token links do the same with `token`.
- Do not expose port `5088` directly to the public internet.
- Use a token or account when other people can access the network.
- Use a VPN for access away from home. Tailscale is one option, not a requirement.
- A VPN works with both the standalone server and Windows Server mode.
- HTTPS termination can be added through a trusted reverse proxy.

With Tailscale, replace the LAN address with the server's private Tailscale address:

```text
http://100.x.y.z:5088
```

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) before exposing a server beyond a trusted LAN.
