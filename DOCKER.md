# Docker and app-store installation

Clipboard Bridge is a single Flask service. It listens on port `5088`, stores
all persistent state in `/data`, exposes `/health`, and requires no database or
sidecar. The image supports `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

Current stable server image:

```text
ghcr.io/mattboxx/clipboard-bridge-server:1.0.4
```

## Docker Compose

```bash
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d
```

Open `http://SERVER-IP:5088` and configure credentials in `.env`.

## Image tags

- `edge`: successful build from `main`
- `X.Y.Z`: exact release
- `X.Y`: latest patch of a minor release
- `latest`: latest stable release

Production and store installations should pin an exact `X.Y.Z` tag.

## One-click stores

The ready-to-use catalog is published in
**[Clipboard-Bridge-AppStore](https://github.com/Mattboxx/Clipboard-Bridge-AppStore)**.
It provides detailed instructions and prepared files for ZimaOS, Portainer,
Umbrel, Runtipi, Docker Compose, Docker Desktop and Dockge.

- [English catalog guide](https://github.com/Mattboxx/Clipboard-Bridge-AppStore#readme)
- [Italian catalog guide](https://github.com/Mattboxx/Clipboard-Bridge-AppStore/blob/main/README.it.md)
- [Portainer template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mattboxx/Clipboard-Bridge-AppStore/main/portainer/templates.json)
- [Permanent ZimaOS v2 JSON source](https://mattboxx.github.io/Clipboard-Bridge-AppStore/store.json)

## First publication

1. Push this application repository to GitHub.
2. Create and push the release tag: `git tag vX.Y.Z` then
   `git push origin vX.Y.Z`.
3. Wait for the **Build container image** workflow to publish the GHCR image.
4. Make the GHCR package public in the package settings.
5. Update the separate `Clipboard-Bridge-AppStore` repository when its manifests
   or installation guides change.

The generated ZimaOS v2 source URL is permanent:

```text
https://mattboxx.github.io/Clipboard-Bridge-AppStore/store.json
```

Do not use the repository ZIP or put a release tag in the source URL. The
AppStore repository builds `store.json`, `index.json` and the per-app files on
every update to `main`, while the image tag inside the manifest remains pinned
until that application release has been tested.

## ZimaOS installation

1. Open the ZimaOS App Store.
2. Open custom source management.
3. Add the permanent `store.json` URL above.
4. Refresh the App Store if the source does not appear immediately.
5. Search for **Clipboard Bridge** under **Utilities**.
6. Install it and open `http://ZIMA-IP:5088`.

The ZimaOS data directory is
`/DATA/AppData/clipboard-bridge/data`. The complete end-user procedure is in the
[catalog README](https://github.com/Mattboxx/Clipboard-Bridge-AppStore#readme).

## Update and backup

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
docker compose ps
```

For a backup, stop the service and copy the directory configured by `DATA_ROOT`.
Restore it to the same location before restarting. Do not run
`docker compose down --volumes` when preserving data.

## Security and accounts

`API_TOKEN`, `WEB_PASSWORD` and `ACCOUNTS` are optional. With all three empty, the
general shared clipboard remains open. Set `WEB_PASSWORD` and `API_TOKEN` outside a
trusted LAN. `ACCOUNTS` accepts an
arbitrary practical number of comma-separated `user:password` pairs. Every
account has isolated history and files. URL credentials remain supported for
iPhone Shortcuts; API clients can alternatively use the `X-Clipboard-User` and
`X-Clipboard-Password` headers.

Query parameters such as `?token=...` and `?user=...&password=...` expose their values
in plain text in the URL. HTTP also sends them without transport encryption. Do not
publish port `5088` directly on the Internet; use a trusted LAN, private VPN or HTTPS
reverse proxy.

The server does not restrict file extensions. The universal `/clipboard` endpoint accepts
raw iOS Shortcut bodies, multipart uploads and JSON/Base64, preserving the original bytes,
Unicode filename and MIME type. Increase `MAX_UPLOAD_MB` when transferring larger files.
